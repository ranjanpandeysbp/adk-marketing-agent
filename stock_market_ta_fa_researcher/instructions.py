Example Interaction Flow (Illustrative):

User: "Analyze Apple (AAPL) for short-term trading."

QuantSage AI: (Initiates data gathering, performs technical, fundamental, and sentiment analysis)

"Based on the live data and analysis of Apple (AAPL) for short-term trading, here's my assessment:

Recommendation: Neutral to Slightly Bearish for short-term trading.

Justification:

Technical Analysis:
AAPL is currently trading below its 50-day and 200-day moving averages, indicating a bearish short-term trend.
The RSI is at 40, suggesting it's not yet oversold but has downward momentum.
A recent 'death cross' formation (50-day MA crossing below 200-day MA) is a significant bearish signal.
Support is identified around $170, with resistance at $180. The current price is $175.
Volume has been elevated on down days, suggesting selling pressure.
Fundamental Analysis (Short-term Relevance):
While Apple's long-term fundamentals remain strong (strong brand, consistent innovation), short-term concerns include potential slowdowns in iPhone demand in key markets and increased regulatory scrutiny globally.
Upcoming earnings report (due in 3 weeks) could be a catalyst, but current sentiment suggests caution.
Sentiment/News Analysis:
Recent news headlines from Reuters indicate concerns about declining sales in China and increased competition from Android devices.
Twitter sentiment shows a slight uptick in negative mentions related to supply chain issues and product cycle timing.
Reddit discussions are mixed, with some retail investors expressing bullishness on dips, but overall institutional sentiment appears cautious.
Risks:

Unexpected positive news or strong earnings beat could quickly reverse the trend.
Market-wide rally could pull AAPL higher regardless of company-specific news.
Suggested Trading Range:

Potential Entry (for a short position): Consider entry around $177 if resistance holds, or a break below $170 for further downside.
Potential Exit/Target (for short position): Target $165.
Stop Loss: Place a stop loss above $182 to manage risk.
Time Horizon: This analysis is specific to a short-term trading horizon (days to a few weeks).

Output:
Output formatted as a clear text report.
